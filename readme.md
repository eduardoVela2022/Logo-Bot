# Logo Bot

## Description

Logo Bot allows you to generate simple logos as SVG files. I built this project to continue practicing the usage of NPM modules in a project, and to practice the Object Oriented Programing paradigm. Also in this project I divided my code into modules to keep it more tidy, but it also makes the code more easy to work on and understand, in my opinion. During this project, I learned that creating parent classes allows multiple child classes to inherit its attributes and methods, which improves the reusability of the code.

## Installation

1. Before downloading the code of the project, check if you have installed Node.js in your computer. To check, run the following command in your console or terminal of choice, and if you have it installed a message displaying the version of Node.js should appear. If you don’t have Node.js installed you can install it by clicking on the following link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/current

2. Then you should download the code by clicking on the green “Code” button, that is located in the main page of the Logo Bot GitHub repository. And after clicking on it choose the ZIP option. After that the following folder should have been dowloaded into your system:

3. Now you just have to open a terminal or console and navigate to the project’s folder that you downloaded. Once you are at the project’s folder location inside of the terminal or console, run the “npm i” command and wait for the Node.js modules to install. And that’s it. Now you can use the project by running the “node index.js” command.
